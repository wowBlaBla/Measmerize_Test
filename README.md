# Measmerize Software Engineering Technical Assessment

This repository contains my solution for the Measmerize Software Engineering Technical Assessment. The assessment involved rearranging a flat array of unsorted nodes into a sorted tree structure.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement required implementing a solution that rearranges a flat array of nodes into a sorted tree structure. Each node in the array has properties such as `nodeId`, `name`, `parentId`, and `previousSiblingId`. The solution needed to consider the relationships between nodes and place them under their respective parents, considering their order among siblings.

## Solution

I have implemented the solution in JavaScript. The code can be found in `index.js`

## Prerequisites

Node

## Instructions

To run the solution and see the expected output, please follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/wowBlaBla/Measmerize_Test.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Measmerize_Test`
3. Run the command: `node index.js`
4. The expected output can be found in the `output`(output) directory.

## Code Explanation

Throughout the code, I have provided comments to explain my thinking process, logic, and any important considerations. Please refer to the code files for detailed explanations.

## Conclusion

This assessment allowed me to showcase my algorithmic skills, code quality, and problem-solving abilities. I thoroughly enjoyed working on it and am excited to discuss my solution further.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback.

Thank you!
